        To become a part of the administration team, there are several steps to
        follow.
        <strong>Application Submission:</strong> Begin by filling out the Google
        Form with your details and reasons for wanting to join our admin team.
        After submitting your application, you will receive a confirmation
        message acknowledging receipt of your application.
        <strong>Application Review:</strong> Our team will review your
        application to assess your fit for the role. If you are shortlisted, you
        will be contacted with further instructions on the next steps.
        <strong>Trial Period:</strong> You will be added to "The Bible
        Community" in the "Administrator Chat," where you will continuously
        submit your posts for review. It's essential to follow our guidelines
        and submit your content for evaluation. During this phase, you will
        receive feedback to help you improve.
        <strong>Final Evaluation:</strong> Throughout the trial period, your
        posts will be monitored for consistency and quality. Based on your
        performance, you will either be offered a spot as a main channel
        administrator or receive feedback if not selected.
        <strong>Becoming an Admin:</strong> If successful, you will be welcomed
        as an official admin with access to the main channel and provided with
        the final guidelines for your role.
